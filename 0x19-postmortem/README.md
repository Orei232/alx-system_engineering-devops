Service Outage - June 10, 2023

Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 14:00 - 17:30 (PST)
Impact: Complete outage of the API service, resulting in the rejection of all user requests. Approximately 80% of users were affected.

Timeline:
- 14:00: Monitoring alerts detected a sudden drop in API response time.
- Actions taken: Engineering team investigated the API server and associated infrastructure.
- Misleading investigation: Initial assumptions pointed to increased traffic or load balancer misconfiguration.
- 15:30: Incident escalated to DevOps team, revealing a network configuration error in the database cluster.
- 16:00: DevOps team identified the root cause as the network configuration error, impacting API connectivity.
- 16:30: Network settings were reconfigured, restoring proper connectivity.
- 17:30: API service successfully restored, users regained access.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root cause: Network configuration error in the database cluster, preventing API connections and request processing. Likely occurred during infrastructure update.
Resolution: DevOps team corrected network routing tables and firewall rules, establishing database connectivity and normal operations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve infrastructure deployment process: Strengthen testing and review procedures for updates to minimize misconfigurations.
   - Task: Implement stricter code review and testing requirements for infrastructure changes.

2. Enhance monitoring capabilities: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to service disruptions.
   - Task: Enhance monitoring to include database connectivity and performance metrics.

3. Disaster recovery testing: Conduct regular drills to verify backup and recovery effectiveness.
   - Task: Schedule monthly disaster recovery tests to validate service restoration capabilities.

4. Increase system redundancy: Implement redundant components and failover mechanisms to enhance reliability.
   - Task: Evaluate feasibility of redundant database cluster or database replication.

5. Incident response training: Conduct training sessions to familiarize teams with incident response protocols.
   - Task: Schedule quarterly incident response training sessions for preparedness.

These measures aim to enhance service resilience, minimize downtime, and improve the user experience.

In conclusion, the June 10, 2023, service outage was caused by a network configuration error in the database cluster. The issue was resolved by reconfiguring network settings. Moving forward, improvements will be made to infrastructure deployment, monitoring capabilities, disaster recovery testing, system redundancy, and incident response training to prevent similar incidents.
